How will the site deliver the desired perception_?

The language of the website is intended to be friendly, approachable, easy to read and ensuring that the reader is not overwhelmed as we intend for the content to be easy to digest and not complicated. In addition, the tone used will be very informal and instructional as this is a how to guide and targeted at beginners 
The visual attributes of our site are intended to be bright and colourful to capture the user’s full attention. We intend to use images and graphics to help portray a similar tone to what we want to convey with the language. 


## Communication strategy

_What are the primary messages you want to convey to the target audience? What makes your guide unique? What can you do that other guides can&#39;t? Briefly explain how the new site will convey the primary messages_.
